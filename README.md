## What is Thyme?
Thyme is a scripting language made for [Algodoo](algodoo.com)'s engine.


This project includes
- An [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) grammar
- A source code validator using a "Compiler" like structure
- A editor featuring [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/)
- A Thyme mode for [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/)

Work in progress, but already usable.
